## How to install it ?
### 1. Import `install.sql` into your DBMS (e.g. MySQL)
### 2. Change the credentials of server files
In order to enable all the plugins you have to edit the `server.lua` files and sometimes `settings.lua` in each packages present in the `resources/`directory. 
That means you have to fill the database name, login and password fields to allow a connection to the database. 

#### Example with [resources/jobs/police](https://github.com/xchopin/FiveM-RP-Boilerplate/blob/master/resources/%5Bjobs%5D/police)
In this package you have a file named [server.lua](https://github.com/xchopin/FiveM-RP-Boilerplate/blob/master/resources/%5Bjobs%5D/police/server.lua), at the line 2 you have to add the database credentials.
